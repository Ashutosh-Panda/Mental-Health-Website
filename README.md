**MIND MENDER**

During the lockdown era mental breakdowns were common as many people lost their jobs and were away from their families. Both mental and physical health are essential for everyone. To know about one’s problem they would need to visit through a number of website. So we thought of making this process a lot easier for everyone. We gather the stories of peoples who have suffered through the same situation so that other people can experience through it. Timing of sessions taken by experts.

**HOW WE BUILT IT **

We used html, CSS, and Bootstrap for front end. We have different sections like blogs, health problems, and live sessions were users can register for them.   

**CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO**

We first started with react but then shifted to html, CSS as this was our first project working as a team and not everyone was on the same level. While working with CSS and Bootstrap together, we faced few problems which was solved after doing some research. Then while getting our project on github we faced problems to work as a team such as uploading the project and merging it together, as it was our first time working on a collaborative project.   

**BUILT WITH**

1.	HTML
2.	CSS
3.	Bootstrap
    
**WHAT’S NEXT FOR MIND MENDER**

Next we want to introduce a chat section where people can interact with each other and share their experiences. This would eventually create a community where people can easily talk about themselves. And users can also write and share their stories. Our future aim is to enhance user-interactivity, develop the backend part, make front-end even more appealing.
